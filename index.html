        When we first went walked through the home the layout was almost perfect, except for the kitchen, eating area and formal dining. We aren’t formal people therefore we didn’t see a point for a formal dining room not to mention it completely disrupted the flow of the downstairs.  Additionally, the size of the kitchen and informal eating area just didn’t make sense for the rest of the home. A 4-bedroom home should have a big kitchen.  You have to assume that if the house is full, then you’ll be cooking for a crowd, which could not be done in that tiny kitchen.

        Here is a layout of the home with after the changes.  As you can see, we decided to get rid of the formal dining room completely.  We then created a pantry and moved the kitchen over into what used to be the dining room, which allowed for a much larger kitchen and eating area.  It also gave us some much-needed space for storage in the kitchen.

        We replaced the flooring with wood (composite) and tile (porcelain). The wood flooring is from Lumber Liquidators.  It looks so much like real wood.  The tile, which is from Arizona Tile, on the other hand is one of the few regrets we have for this space.  We like the durability of the porcelain tile but we picked a dark matte finish.  A dark matte finish shows everything. When you drop water on it, the water stays.  It actually looks like the tile soaks it in and leaves a stain.  Since it’s porcelain not a natural stone it’s not doing any damage.  The ‘stain’ comes right up when you steam clean the surface but its just added maintenance.
